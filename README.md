# Telco Customer Churn - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn data from a telecom company to understand the key factors influencing customer attrition. 
Using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations that help predict churn behavior.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 
- Pandas
- Seaborn 
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 EDA Objectives

- Understand the structure of the data
- Identify missing values or anomalies
- Analyze the distribution of churn and its relationship with key variables
- Detect patterns in customer demographics and behavior
- Support future model building with feature insights

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Month-to-month contract customers churn more frequently than others.
- Low-tenure customers are more likely to leave the service.
- Electronic check payments are strongly associated with churn.
- Services like Tech Support and Streaming TV have a noticeable effect on churn rates.
- Higher MonthlyCharges are often linked to churned customers.

## ✅ Conclusion

The EDA helped uncover valuable trends in customer behavior and service usage, forming a foundation for predictive modeling and business decision-making.
